      Cassandra module concepts and semantics and the syntax for various stores namespaces. </para><para>This section provides some basic introduction to Spring and the Cassandra database. The rest

      <title>Knowing Spring</title>

      <para>Spring Data uses Spring framework's <ulink
      url="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/spring-core.html">core</ulink>
      functionality, such as the <ulink

      container, <ulink

      exception hierarchy</ulink>. While it is not important to know the
      Spring APIs, understanding the concepts behind them is. At a minimum,
      the idea behind IoC should be familiar for whatever IoC container you
      choose to use.</para>

      <para>The core functionality of the Cassandra support can be used directly, with no need to
        invoke the IoC services of the Spring Container. This is much like
          <classname>JdbcTemplate</classname> which can be used 'standalone' without any other
        services of the Spring container. To leverage all the features of Spring Data Cassandra,
        such as the repository support, you will need to configure some parts of the library using
        Spring.</para>

      <para>To learn more about Spring, you can refer to the comprehensive
      (and sometimes disarming) documentation that explains in detail the
      Spring Framework. There are a lot of articles, blog entries and books on
      the matter - take a look at the Spring framework <ulink

      <title>Knowing NoSQL and Cassandra</title>

      <para>NoSQL stores have taken the storage world by storm. It is a vast domain with a plethora
        of solutions, terms and patterns (to make things worth even the term itself has multiple
          <ulink url="http://www.google.com/search?q=nosoql+acronym">meanings</ulink>). While some
        of the principles are common, it is crucial that the user is familiar to some degree with
        the Cassandra Columnar NoSQL Datastore supported by DATACASS. The best way to get acquainted
        to this solutions is to read their documentation and follow their examples - it usually
        doesn't take more then 5-10 minutes to go through them and if you are coming from an
        RDMBS-only background many times these exercises can be an eye opener.</para>
